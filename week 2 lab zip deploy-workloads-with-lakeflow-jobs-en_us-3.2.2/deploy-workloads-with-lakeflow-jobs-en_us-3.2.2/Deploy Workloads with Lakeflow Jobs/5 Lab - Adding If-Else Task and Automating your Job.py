# MAGIC # 5 Lab - Adding If-Else Task and Automating Your Job
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Duration: ~15 minutes
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Learning Objectives
# MAGIC By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
# MAGIC * Add conditional logic to a Databricks job
# MAGIC * Schedule your job for automated execution
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Lab Scenario
# MAGIC You have already created two tables: **borrower_details_silver** and **loan_details_silver** from the **bank_master_data_bronze** dataset. In this lab, you will further transform these silver tables, focusing on the loan details table, and implement conditional logic to handle high-risk borrowers.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## C. Explore the New Task Files
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Let's build upon the last lab by exploring the notebooks we want to add to the job. The notebooks can be found in **Task Files** > **Lesson 5 Files**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Use the links below to view and explore the code for each task:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - [Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.1 - Processing high risk borrowers]($./Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.1 - Processing high risk borrowers)
# MAGIC   - This notebook identifies high-risk borrowers, processes them, and stores their data in the **high_risk_borrowers_silver** table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - [Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.2 - Processing low risk borrowers]($./Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.2 - Processing low risk borrowers)
# MAGIC   - This notebook identifies low-risk borrowers, processes them, and stores their data in the **low_risk_borrowers_silver** table.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## D. Adding an If/Else Conditional Task
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, you will add a conditional task to your job that checks for high-risk borrowers in the **loan_details_silver** table. The relevant code can be found in [Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.3 - Creating Loan Details Table]($./Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.3 - Creating Loan Details Table).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Pay close attention to the final commands, as they set the output task value. Whenever the number of borrowers with both an active loan and a credit card exceeds 100, the `risk_flag` is set to **true**.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D1. Review the Notebook: Check for High-Risk Borrowers
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Refer to the notebook [Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.3 - Creating Loan Details Table]($./Task Files/Lesson 2 Files/2.3 - Creating Loan Details Table) to review the `risk_flag` logic for identifying high-risk borrowers in the **loan_details_silver** table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   - The **creating_loan_details_table** task creates the **loan_details_silver** table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   - Your goal is to check whether this table contains more than the allowed number of high-risk borrowers.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   - Stores the result of this check (a boolean value) as `risk_flag` in the task output.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D2. Create an If/Else Conditional Task
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the job that was created, go to the Tasks tab, and add a new task named **checking_for_risky_borrowers**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. Set the task type to **If/Else condition**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Set this task to depend on the **creating_loan_details_table** task.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. Select the condition by clicking on the `{}` button, then choose tasks.`creating_loan_details_table.values.my_value` and replace `my_value` with `risk_flag`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <!-- 5. For the condition, use the output value from the **creating_loan_details_table** task: `tasks.creating_loan_details_table.values.risk_flag` (Include the condition in double quotes) -->
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. Set the condition to check if this value is `== true`: `tasks.creating_loan_details_table.values.risk_flag == true`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 6. Click on **Save Task**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ![Lesson05_ifelse](./Includes/images/Lesson05_ifelse.png)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D3. Handle the True Condition
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. If high-risk borrowers are found (`risk_flag == true`), add a notebook task named **processing_high_risk_borrowers**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. This task should depend on the **True** branch of the **checking_for_risky_borrowers** task.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Use the notebook [Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.1 - Processing high risk borrowers]($./Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.1 - Processing high risk borrowers) for this condition.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ![Lesson05_if_task.png](./Includes/images/Lesson05_if_task.png)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### D4. Handle the False Condition
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. If high-risk borrowers are less than threshold (`risk_flag == false`), add a notebook task named **processing_low_risk_borrowers**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. This task should depend on the **False** branch of the **checking_for_risky_borrowers** task.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. Use the notebook [Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.2 - Processing low risk borrowers]($./Task Files/Lesson 5 Files/5.2 - Processing low risk borrowers) for this condition.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. This setup ensures your job processes high-risk and low-risk borrowers separately.
