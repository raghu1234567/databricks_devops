# MAGIC #### Setting Up Task Values
# MAGIC We will set up task values to be used in another task. 
# MAGIC - First, we extract the `loan_details_silver` table and save it as a DataFrame. 
# MAGIC - Next, we apply a filter to identify customers who hold both a credit card and a personal loan. 
# MAGIC - These customers are categorized as **risky customers**.
# MAGIC - We will count the number of such customers, and if the count exceeds 100, we will set the `risk_flag` to true.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE: We are setting up task values for our next task. You will learn more about task values in upcoming lectures before actually using them in the next lab.**

# COMMAND ----------

## Getting Dataframe for setting Task Value
loan_details_df = spark.read.table("loan_details_silver")

# COMMAND ----------

# Checking for risky customers
## Condition: users with both a credit card and a personal loan

risky_customers_df = loan_details_df.filter(
    (loan_details_df['has_credit_card'] == True) & (loan_details_df['has_personal_loan'] == True)
)

# Getting count of risky customers
risk_count = risky_customers_df.count()
print(f"Number of users with both personal loan and credit card: {risk_count}")

# COMMAND ----------

# Decide flag
## We are going to set the flag to True if there are more than 100 customers with both personal loan and credit card
### This task value is going to used by next lab task
status = True if risk_count > 100 else False
dbutils.jobs.taskValues.set(key="risk_flag", value=status)
